# Note Taker


## User Story

```
As a small business person I want a simple note taking app to keep track of tasks and activities during my busy day. I want to be able to add new notes, see them posted and delete notes within a basic user interface
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
When I open the app I am taken to the home page where I can click on a button
to go to the notes page 
I am then presented with the existing notes on the left-column
and an empty field to add new notes and save them with the save button to render in the list on the left-column
When I click on the existing notes the notes populate to the right-column
If I want to add a new note I click on the + sign in the nav bar and can enter a new note
I can delete a note from the notes page by selecting it in the left-column and click on the delete icon

```
